 - The front end for our web application
 - Dynamically visualizes the simulated spread of misinformation in the social network
 - Red nodes represent bots promoting idea A, blue nodes represent bots promoting idea B, and black nodes represent non-bots
 - The borders represent the current status of the node (i.e. if a non-bot was converted to spreading point A, then the black node  would have a red border)
 - The edges change color based on which idea the source  node is sharing to its destination node
